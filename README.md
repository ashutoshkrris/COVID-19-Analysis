# COVID-19 Analysis

 In this project, we are going to work with the COVID-19 dataset, published by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE), which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each country. Also, we have another dataset of World Happiness Report 2019, published by Sustainable Development Solutions Network, that consists of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe.  We are going to merge these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
 
 The above mentioned datasets can be downloaded from the below links :
